This was made as an end of semester academic project for my GUI course. We had to create a student information system.
The user is first met with a log in window, where there are two types of users, professors and students.
AFter logging in, the program allowed students to view personal and course details, and they could add and drop courses.
It allowed professors to view their own personal and course details, register to teach another course or stop teaching an existing
one, change student's grades and their own usernames and passwords. 
The project was implemented with an MVC structure, OOP and Java GUI libraries.
